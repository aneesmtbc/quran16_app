# Welcome to Quran App!
**Introduction**

This Quran application is for those who benefit from the Quran in Pak-India (برصغیر) style.

***Quranic Text Styles***

There are differences in the style of writing text in the Quranic texts of Pakistan, India, and Arab countries.
In this app, I must follow the Mushaf that Quran reciters read in Indo-Pak to recite and memorize the Quran.

**Mushaf (مصحف) in Pak-India**

This Mushaf typically has 16 lines per page, and the total number of pages is approximately 550.
Each line contains 8 to 10 words.
In Pakistan and India, the text of the Quran is divided into seven sections for ease of reading.
The aim is that if one stage is read daily, the Quran can be recited entirely in a week.
The minor division of the stages is the Juz or Para (پارہ) and the Surahs.
Unlike Arabic or Usmani style text, here, a part or surah is divided into ruku', ruba', nisaf,' and salasah instead of Hizb.

**Objectives**

Typically, hafiz or qaris use images or PDFs to read and teach the text of the Quran on digital devices or the internet. 
I want to show Unicode-based text.
Then, I will add more features to it later.
